# Hybrid Physics Attempt (January 2025)

This archive contains the attempt to integrate Matter.js physics into the existing DOS-style game code.

## Issues Found:
- Dual physics systems (original + Matter.js) causing synchronization problems
- Rotation control complexity (hybrid manual + physics approach)
- deltaTime application inconsistencies
- Difficult to debug and extend

## Decision:
Restart with Matter.js as the core foundation rather than an addition.
