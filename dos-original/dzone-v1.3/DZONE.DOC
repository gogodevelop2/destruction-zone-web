                               ABOUT THE GAME

  Destruction Zone is a science fiction tank war game. It requires a  VGA  card

and will run on any PC/AT machine. Although written for a 486, D-Zone  runs  at

a similar speed on slower computers by lowering the detail of movement.



                       DESTRUCTION ZONE - THE REAL GAME

  Somewhere near the centre of our galaxy lies an enormous dark  station.  From

time to time, a group of challengers travel out to the station to turn  on  the

lights, transforming the 'Dark Zone' into the 'Destruction Zone'.

  The station has three levels of different sizes. Each level is large in area,

but the ceiling lies only a few metres above the floor. It is the battle field

for the most famous war game in the galaxy.

  A series of triangular tanks essentially made up of three huge cylinders, are

teleported into the zone and hover in their positions, repelled from the  floor

and ceiling by strong electric forces. The liquid fuel of each tank can be seen

splashing around in the inside of each cylinder and by looking closely  inside,

a few cables and tubes are also visible. Due to the radioactive fuels used each

tank softly radiates a unique colour.

   As the Destruction Zone becomes even brighter, the tanks start to move.  The

first round has begun. The tank controllers switch between a range of  weapons,

blasting their foes in all directions.

   As time passes, the tanks glow dimmer, for they are all low on weapon  fuel.

They wait in corners, absorbing the Zone light until they  glow  brighter,  and

then they launch another attack.

   When a tank has taken too much damage, it is teleported out of the Zone with

the unharmed controller, so everyone lives  to  play  another  game.  From  all

around the galaxy, the D-Zone enthusiasts are waiting for the next  score-board

update.

                                                                          page 3

   Every three rounds, competitors are allowed to spend their hard-earned money

in the Destruction Zone Shop, where advanced weaponry and special tools can  be

purchased for a suitable price. Membership discounts are available.

   Sometimes there are not enough willing to play the game which is  why  robot

tanks are often required. The robots  all  have  different  personalities,  and

combat standards, and some are even a challenge for highly ranked D-Zoners.








   This game is a simulation of the game described above, with each tank  being

represented by a three point vector image, and controlled using  a  combination

of six different keys:  Forwards, backwards,  turn  left,  turn  right,  change

weapon, and fire. The background is generated randomly at the beginning of each

round and the Destruction Zone is viewed from above.

   Most of the game is easy to work out without any instructions, so  the  rest

of this manual only contains information about what each key does, the  scoring

system, and a description of each shop item and robot tank.





KEYS USED IN THE OPTION SCREEN:


   CURSOR KEYS             Change hi-lighted box.
   RETURN or SPACEBAR      Toggle information in box.

   To select a human player, move the hi-light to player 1 box and press RETURN
   until a cursor appears in the box. Now enter name and press RETURN once more.
   The 'rounds' can also be changed quickly using the PgUp, PgDn, + and - keys.

   It is important to know which box corresponds to which player:

                  PLAYERS    x      PLAYER 1        PLAYER 4
                  ROUNDS    xx      PLAYER 2        PLAYER 5

   Only the first three players can be controlled from the keyboard. The keys
   for each player are shown below, but may be re-defined by running SETUP.EXE

                                                                          page 4
KEYS USED IN SHOPPING SCREEN:

   CURSOR KEYS            Change hi-lighted box.
   RETURN or SPACEBAR     Buy a weapon, end shopping, abort game, save  current
                          game, or load a different game. For loading or saving
                          if 'enter' is pressed twice without typing  the  file
                          name, the file 'UNKNOWN' is used.
   PAGE UP or HOME        View information on the current item. If  the  cursor
                          does not move for a few seconds, the item information
                          is requested automatically.

   If you want to end the round press ESC. This is used when  computer  players
   become stuck after all human players are out. By pressing ESC, the remaining
   players receive a predicted score and money bonus depending on the amount of
   weapon energy and shield energy each tank  has.  Living  human  players  are
   assumed to be destroyed when ESC is pressed, so they get no bonus. Only  use
   this quitting option to quickly get to the shopping menu to save the game or
   when the robots are taking too long to finish the round.


   SETUP.EXE - CHANGING TANK CONTROLS:

   You may find the default tank controls to be rather awkward, in  which  case
   you should re-define them (for any of the players) using SETUP.

   Do not be afraid to change the settings in SETUP, after all, hitting  RETURN
   through any of the questions results in a return to the default settings.

   Game options that can be changed in SETUP.EXE are:

      1) Re-defining tank control keys.
      2) Specifying which D-Zone to use - there are three sizes.
      3) Choosing the kind of sound to be used.
      4) Registering the game, to remove message at start.
      5) Altering game speed.
      6) Allowing game to double in speed when only robot tanks remain.
      7) Choosing type of robot that can take over your controls.
      8) Rotating tank colours from tank to tank.

                                                                          page 5
SCORING:

   TANK POINTS - TEAMS MODE AND HOSTILE MODE

      KILLING A TANK:   3 points
      DAMAGING A TANK:  1 point for every unit of damage done
                        (up to 40 points)

      A tank takes 40 units of damage to be destroyed,  so  43  points  can  be
      earned for a complete kill. Hitting a tank with good  armour  means  that
      each hit does less damage, so each hit must also earn a lower  score. For
      this reason it is best to pick on the tanks with poor  armour  first,  to
      get the most out of your weapon energy.

      In team mode, additional tank points are earned for firing at  the  enemy
      jewel. This means that it is a good idea to fire at the jewel while it is
      slowing down, after all the enemy tanks have been destroyed.


   TEAM POINTS - TEAMS MODE ONLY

      A team receives 1 point for every unit of  damage  done  to  the  enemy's
      jewel - up to 50 points. A jewel continually receives  damage  after  all
      members of the team are out. No team points are earned for destroying  or
      damaging tanks, although tank points are still  obtained  this  way.  The
      team leader is the player who has the highest tank score. Tank points are
      lost for firing at members of the same team.


   GETTING MONEY

      Ten credits are received for every unit of damage done, either  to  tanks
      or jewels, so a maximum of 400 credits can be  earned  for  destroying  a
      tank and 500 credits for completely destroying a jewel.

   THE STATISTICS BOARD

      The statistics board is shown every 15 rounds, at the end of the game, or
      when 's' is pressed from the score-board. The information is mostly  self
      explanatory. The 'hit-fire ratio' represents the firing efficiency, hence
      a low value is given to the players who use low-damage weapons  or  often
      miss the target. The 'current weapon' shows a number  beside  the  weapon
      name which is the amount of times that weapon can be fired before it runs
      out. Note that you can still select the 'current weapon' after your  tank
      has been destroyed in order to find out how many charges it has left.

      The rest of the statistical information should not need explaining.

                                                                          page 6


INFORMATION ON ITEMS:

   There are three different types of items: TANKS,  WEAPONS,  and  TOOLS.  The
   prices move up and down with the player's ranking, in an attempt to keep the
   game more even. All the prices given below assume that  the  buyer  has  the
   average score of all the tanks.

   Sometimes some of the special weapons do not seem to be worth the money, but
   they were all put into the game for a reason - it may simply require  a  bit
   of imagination to use some of them effectively. The descriptions  given  may
   contain some useful ideas.



   TANKS:

      Each tank has four attributes: Speed (forwards and backwards), rotational
      speed, armour and size. Upgrades for rotation, speed, and armour  can  be
      bought for the same price as the tank. If you have  bought  upgrades  for
      a tank and then buy a new tank, the upgrades are NOT  carried  across  to
      the new tank. When buying a tank, consider its potential attributes (with
      everything upgraded) aswell as the set attributes.


      STANDARD TANK        This is the tank that all players begin with. It has
                           a slow turning rate and is the largest tank of all.
                           This tank is unlisted for wealthy players.

                           The number in brackets is the value after an upgrade
                           has been bought. SH-shield, ROT-rotation, SP-speed.
                           SH 3(4)       ROT 4(6)       SP 2(3)     Price: 1000

      ROTRA I              This 'Rotation Tank' was the first non-standard tank
                           used for D-Zone combat. It has a much better rate of
                           rotation and has improved armour.
                           SH 4(6)       ROT 6(9)       SP 2(3)     Price: 1850

      ROTRA II             The compact version of the ROTRA I was designed  for
                           even better manoeuvrability.  This  tank is  a  good
                           alternative to the larger tanks. It  has  very  poor
                           armour and relies on a skillful controller  to dodge
                           all the missiles.
                           SH 2(3)       ROT 8(12)      SP 3(4)     Price: 2450

      OPEC I               The expensive OPEC series were designed  for  faster
                           velocity while maintaining good rotations speeds. It
                           has fairly good armour, and very good attribues when
                           fully upgraded.
                           SH 4(6)       ROT 6(9)       SP 3(4)     Price: 3400

      OPEC II              A high price is required for the OPEC II -  slightly
                           smaller than the original OPEC, with  better  armour
                           and a faster turning rate.
                           SH 5(7)       ROT 7(10)      SP 3(4)     Price: 4750

                                                                          page 7
WEAPONS:

      Each tank has seven weapon ports, used for different purposes,  and  each
      weapon occupies a particular port. The first port is always used for  the
      front fire weapons, the second port for Blasters, and so on.

      When a new weapon is purchased, a '10' appears in the right of the window
      This means that the weapon can be fired 10*10 times. The same weapon  can
      be bought up to 9 times, giving a maximum of 900 fires.

      Be careful when buying new weapons. New weapons replace any number of old
      weapons of the same port without warning. Use the PAGE UP key before  you
      buy any new weapon, or you may be replacing an even better weapon.


  DESCRIPTIONS:


  [Tank port used]

      [Weapon Name]  [Damage/Energy]   [Description]
          (abbrev)   [Price (assumes a middle ranked player)]


   PORT 1  (Front Fire)


      MISSILE        4/4   This is the weapon that all tanks start with. It  is
         (MISIL)     2     sometimes bought as a low priced backup weapon, and
                           its ability is often underestimated, considering the
                           negligable price. [Unlisted for wealthy players].

      DOUBLE MISSILE 6/4   Improve the power of the  standard  missile  without
         (DOUBL)     100   using any more energy. The low price  makes  this  a
                           good weapon for saving money.

      TRIPLE MISSILE 9/5   The Triple Missile is the next step after the Double
         (TRIPL)     600   Missile. Due to its slow speed and high damage, this
                           weapon is best used for close range combat.

      BEAM LASER     6/6   Like all the low priced weapons, it is a  good  idea
         (LASER)     150   to get used to using the Beam  Laser.  Although  the
                           expensive weapons may do more  damage,  you  are not
                           necessarily making more  money  for  every  unit  of
                           damage done -> Master the low priced weapons.

      POWER LASER    12/6  Power Lasers fire two Beam Lasers while using up the
         (POWER)     1650  energy of only one. It should be used for aiming  at
                           a specific enemy rather than whomever is closest.

      TRI-STRIKER    18/6  The Tri Striker is extremely efficient, but requires
        (STRIK)      3350  great aiming skills when used in long range firing -
                           the primary purpose for this weapon.

                                                                          page 8

   PORT 2  (Blasters)

      BLASTER        90/23 The blasters use the 'double fire' system, where the
         (BLAST)     650   first fire sends out the warhead and the second fire
                           breaks the warhead up into a group of missiles.  The
                           warheads break up automatically when they hit a wall
                           or the tank. The best way to use blasters is to fire
                           at the side of the tank rather. Even then, only half
                           the maximum damage is done on average.

      GUIDE BLASTER  90/28 A blaster with a guided warhead,  suitable  for  the
         (G.BST)     1200  desperate situation when there's no time for careful
                           aiming, or for those who are simply bad at aiming.

      BLAST GUIDER   70/34 The opposite effect to the GUIDE BLASTER. The  BLAST
         (B.GUI)     2500  GUIDER is a normal warhead that breaks into a  group
                           of very effective guided missiles. In  open  spaces,
                           maximum damage can easily be obtained, making this a
                           a very good value for money weapon.

      NUKE BLASTER  168/40 This is the big version of the standard Blaster.  It
         (N.BST)     3400  only takes two or three, and sometimes only one good
                           hit to completely destroy a fully shielded tank.
                           Since the weapon is not fired many times, it ends up
                           being very good value, but must be aimed  carefully.
                           Also, aim at the side of the tank, not at the head.

      SWIRL BLASTER  48/20 On second firing, the warhead will split into six
         (S.BST)     3800  swirlers, each doing eight units of damage.

   PORT 3  (Surprise Attack)

      REAR DOUBLE    8/5   Two missiles are fired parallel out from the rear of
         (REAR2)     130   the tank. The weapon makes a good  surprise  attack,
                           and has a strangely low price considering the damage
                           damage it does. Because of this, many like  to  fire
                           ir from the front of the tank using a TURRET.

      REAR GUIDED    8/5   The REAR GUIDED releases two  guided  missiles  from
         (GREAR)     650   the rear, each doing four units of damage. Very good
                           for attacking while being chased.

      REAR CHAOS     14/5  Miniature guiders are released from the rear of  the
         (CHAOS)     1000  tank to destroy pursuing enemies. The missiles  will
                           die after a short period, so this weapon is only for
                           short range attacks. It can be used in a variety  of
                           interesting ways.

      TELEPORT FOE   0/4   This forces the nearest tank to be teleported  to  a
                     1600  random location. It is useful for escaping a closing
                           tank, or for separating two tanks  in  close  combat
                           which are wasting your 'potential points'.

      REAR TRIPLE    15/6  The REAR TRIPLE is the improved version of the  REAR
         (REAR3)     2200  DOUBLE, doing nearly twice the damage for a  similar
                           use of energy. A good alternative to the TRI STRIKER
                           when used on the front with a TURRET.

                                                                          page 9
   PORT 4  (Special Front Fire)

      TRI BREAKER    21/12 A great starting weapon due to a  very  high  damage
         (T.BRK)     250   per unit cost. On second firing the  missile  splits
                           up into three, each able to do 7 units of damage. An
                           effective way to use BREAKER weapons is  to  make  a
                           direct hit, at which point the warhead breaks up.

      GUIDED         6/6   This is the basic guided missile. It  only  requires
         (GUIDE)     400   approximate aiming to hit the target. Since it has a
                           poor damage/energy ratio, guided missiles  are  only
                           valuable to the unskilled players.

      QUINT BREAKER  30/12 These work the same way as the Tri Breakers,  except
         (Q.BRK)     1350  releasing five missiles instead of three, each doing
                           six units of damage - good value for money.

      QUINT GUIDER   30/20 The Quint Guider is identical to the  Quint  Breaker
         (Q.GUI)     2250  except that it produces guided missiles, and uses up
                           more weapon power.

      OCTO BREAKER   48/16 The OCTO BREAKER is the next level up from the QUINT
         (O.BRK)     4000  BREAKER. It will only take two or three good hits to
                           destroy any tank. Because of  the  high  price,  the
                           players must be careful not to miss their target.

      SPARK FIENDS   16/9  Although the damage does not seem as high  as  other
         (SPARK)     5400  weapons, the fact that the SPARK FIENDS  never  miss
                           their target makes this weapon one of the  best.  It
                           has been put in the game, not for making money,  but
                           for quickly killing off rivals before they can score
                           any points.


   PORT 5  (Aggressive Defence)

      SWIRLER        8/3   A missile is released which swirls around the  tank.
         (SWIRL)     225   Swirlers are usually fired in large numbers  to  get
                           rid of touching or chasing tanks. The SWIRLER has  a
                           particularly high damage/price ratio. A useful skill
                           for destroying a single robot is to circle it  while
                           firing many swirlers, especially with a fast tank.

      ELECTRO BUDS   15/4  Three slow moving missiles are released, each with a
         (ELECT)     800   guiding system. When fired in large numbers they can
                           act as a 'deadly mist'.

      NORMAL BOMB   100/25 The bombs are usually used against robot tanks since
         (NBOMB)     500   they have poor skills for avoiding them. The idea is
                           to have the tank move right over the bomb when it is
                           detonated, where two  or  three  hits  will  usually
                           kill. Sometimes they can be dropped in a place where
                           the enemy is forced to move over.

      DEATH BOMB    350/40 These bombs will usually destroy anything that moves
         (DBOMB)     3250  them during detonation. "Pop". This is actually  the
                           cheapest weapon available by the time all its damage
                           has been done (near-maximum damage can be obtained).

                                                                         page 10
   PORT 6  (Special Defence)

      DEATH TOUCH    15/7  The tank becomes highly charged so that any touching
         (TOUCH)     350   tanks will be badly damaged. The price is  strangely
                           low, to discourage tanks from trapping one another.

      DEFLECTOR      0/0   The Deflector will force all in-coming  missiles  to
         (DEFLE)     2200  suddenly reverse direction, changing from  an  enemy
                           missile to one of your own. Although the device does
                           not use weapon energy, remember that  excessive  use
                           will costs money. Like many weapons, it can be  used
                           with innovation, such converting enemy  SWIRLERS  or
                           GUIDERS to work for your own tank or detonate bombs.

      ECM WIPER      0/4   The Wiper destroys every missile in the zone. It  is
         (WIPE)      800   usually used to aid a friend in teams mode.

      CONFUSOR       0/0   Without using up any energy, this device causes  all
         (ECM)       480   guided missiles to ignore the tank. It is good value
                           but only really useful for players who are  fast  at
                           selecting different weapons.


   PORT 7  (Harmless Defense)

      HEALER        10/10  The Healers convert weapon energy to shield  energy.
         (HEAL)      350   This Healer is only used when the player has  excess
                           weapon energy but is critically down on shields.

      GLOW SHIELD    0/15  Glow shields give complete protection for just a few
         (GLOW)      800   seconds. They are used for getting away from a bunch
                           of close fighting tanks or for attacking in safety.
                           The best use is to turn the shield on, move up  very
                           close to a tank, and fire a  highly  damaging  short
                           range weapon, such as the QUINT BREAKER.

      FADE SHIELD    0/20  The FADE SHIELD is a cloaking device.  It  works  by
         (FADE)      1200  bending light around the tank, and then  letting  it
                           resume its original direction,  effectively  letting
                           light pass through the tank. The FADE  shield  lasts
                           twice as long as the GLOW shield.

      TELEPORT SELF  0/4   This device is useful for  escaping  from  desperate
         (TELEP)     2000  situations or for freeing yourself  when  stuck.  It
                           uses very little energy when its fantastic power  is
                           considered. It can also be useful in Team mode.


TOOL DESCRIPTIONS:

      RED DOT        150 - A red dot  appears  inside  the  tank  whenever  the
                           current weapon is not fireable. Its low price  makes
                           it a standard add-on for most.
      TANK UPGRADES      - You can buy tank upgrades involving speed,  rate  of
                           rotation, and armour. Each upgrade  costs  the  same
                           price as the tank, and it is only  possible  to  buy
                           one of each upgrade per tank.

                                                                         page 11

      SHOPPING CARD 2200 - The  common  shoppers  can  buy  a  D-Zone  discount
                           membership and receive all items for  only  75%  the
                           original price - a definite requirement for the long
                           round games.
      SCORE BRIBE   2500 - This is normally used to convert your residual money
                           into points just before the end of the game.
      FAST RECHARGE 5300 - Increases the weapon recharge rate by fifty percent.
                           If you have many rounds left, save up for this.
      FUEL UPGRADE  8400 - This, the most powerful item available,  will  cause
                           any damage done by you to increase by 66%. The  FUEL
                           UPGRADE is expensive, but when your score and  money
                           is effectively going up by an extra 66% I'm sure you
                           will agree that it's worth saving for.
      RAPID FIRE     450 - This item enables the player to fire rapidly by just
                           holding down the fire button. This item only affects
                           port 1 weapons. Ports 2 to 7 are not affected.
      AUTO HEAL     4800 - Auto Heal allows the shields to slowly recharge, but
                           it is only effective for about the first half minute
                           of each round.
      LARGER DEATH   800 - This allows the tank's explosion to do twenty  times
                           more damage than usual. Enormous damage can be  done
                           by positioning the tank side to side with the enemy,
                           forming a rectangle, before being destroyed.
      TANK TURRET   1400 - Each tank may have a turret installed,  which  holds
                           all the weapon ports. It must be re-installed  every
                           time a new tank is bought. The  turrets  serve  many
                           purposes, depending on the weapon being  used.  Read
                           'Controlling Tank' to learn how to steer the turret.


DESCRIPTION OF ROBOT TANKS:


      R1 PROTOTYPE       - These tanks are very slow thinkers and  also  rather
                           nervous, so they only dare attack the tank with  the
                           lowest score. Don't be too hard on them.
      R2 AIMER           - The Aimers don't like to move around very much,  but
                           they are good at using turrets. Aimers generally aim
                           for the closest tank.
      R3 SEEKER          - This type of robot avoids the  long  range  fighting
                           style and saves all of its weapon energy  for  quick
                           kills at short range. They have a faster firing rate
                           than the AIMERS which makes them a  dangerous  enemy
                           when they are close. They always aim for the closest
                           tank.
      R4 HUNTER          - Only the leaders of  the  game should  be  concerned
                           with the Hunters. They will not even try  to  attack
                           those which it thinks are inferior. It is  not  very
                           difficult to take advantage of the Hunter's pride.
      R5 DESTROYER       - The Destroyers will  viciously  attack  the  closest
                           tank in range at all times, particularly by the  use
                           of turrets. Because these tanks, like  the  Hunters,
                           are fairly efficient with their firing, they tend to
                           have a lot of credits left over at the end of a long
                           game, which they spend on SCORE BRIBES - so remember
                           to compare your credits aswell as  your  score  with
                           the DESTROYER towards the end of the game.

SPECIAL MISSIONS

The missions are described from the SHOW MISSIONS option at the main  menu.  It
is up to you to set the game up (types of tanks, number of players, etc .. ) to
fit the mission description. Sometimes there is only one way to set the game up
but other missions allow more freedom and so the setup process becomes part  of
the challenge, and requires your imagination.

If you succeed in any of the missions, a message such as 'mission 1 completed'
will appear on the final score-board in the colour of the corresponding tank.

Missions are not listed in any particular order. Read the descriptions very
carefully or you may miss out on a vital piece of information.










                                 REGISTRATION

   If you enjoy this game, you should get a registered version which only costs
$25. For this you will receive a password corresponding to your name that  will
remove the annoying message at the start, and prevents the game  from  quitting
suddenly in the middle. Remember that further development to this game  depends
only on how much support I get from you. So far, each letter has given  me  the
enthusiasm to add one or two new things to the game.  Without  any  letters,  I
wouldn't make any changes to the game, after spending about six  hundred  hours
planning, programming and testing.

   Payers can send an extra $5 to have the latest version of D-Zone  posted  to
them on a 3.5" disk. I only release a few versions below the latest publicly so
the latest versions can only be obtained through myself. (You are assured  that
the address given below will not change.)

   If you like, include a note explaining any improvements  you would  wish  to
see in the game, and remember to mention which version you currently have. Your
ideas may found in the next version.
