This file lists MOST of the things added to D-Zone after the initial release.

are interested in the new features.

              Statistics board in teams mode all working properly.
              CLOSE RANGE firing at another tank now effective on slow
              computers.

     AUTO HEALER, SPARK FIENDS, FAST RECHARGE, LARGER DEATH.
   New robot: R5 Destroyer, uses heavier armour.
   Each item reviewed.. Most items behave differently now, eg weapons

     has better armour, many little things I can't remember..

   A few weapons altered, or replaced by different weapons, eg TELEPORT FOE.
   Missions added - read end of DZONE.DOC.
   Coloured missiles supported properly.
   Missiles pass through RED DOT as they should.

Mar 93, D-Zone v1.2 released

   New weapon: REAR CHAOS replaces TWIN SEEKERS
   New item: TANK TURRET.
   All robot tanks re-programmed, now have personal characteristics:
     Prototypes (now very nervous) head for the tank with lowest score.
     Aimers often sit still and use turrets on the nearest tank.
     Seekers remain unchanged (head for nearest tank) and can't use turrets.
     Hunters generally head for highest scoring tank and use turrets.
     Destroyers destroy anything in range, and love using turrets.
   The trigonometric functions in the programming had previously been rather
     approximate to keep the game running fast. These approximations have
     been removed, resulting in much better robot opponents.
   Human tanks are temporarily replaced by a robot (chosen in SETUP) when
     completely neglected for a round. The human can resume at any time.
   Title page re-done.

Aug 93, D-Zone v1.3 ready for registered users.

     automatically saved as game starts. Missions added (from four to eight).
   Bug fixed: SAVE GAME now stores the team score.
   New item: DEFLECTOR replaces ECM HACKER
   New weapons: SWIRL BLASTER and OCTO BREAKER.
   New ray-traced background in shopping screen.
   Bug fixes: DEATH TOUCH works properly. Robots which have taken over humans
     do not remain as robots when the game has finished.
